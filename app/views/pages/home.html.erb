                                Tiandra Ray, a teaching assistant at the MITES program just received her diploma from MIT with a major in architecture. Her early life and aspirations were influenced by a household that encouraged learning and gave her freedom to explore her interests. This freedom let her discover her talents and passions, which lay in art, music, math, and science. Learning was always incorporated into play, instead of presented as a chore.

                                Did you ever wonder if you’d weigh less on the Moon than here on Earth? Are you fascinated by velocity problems? Our goal here is that with a little bit of thought, you’ll have fun working through these physics predicaments. Don’t worry if you find these questions challenging! Like the rest of the quizzes on Bundle, this one increases in difficulty and encompass a variety of levels of material - being stumped is simply part of learning process!
